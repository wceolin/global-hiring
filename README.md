# Global Hiring

Have you ever spent a lot of time applying for a remote job just to find out the company you're applying to doesn't hire in your country?
This happened to me. That's why I've decided to create a list of companies hiring globally.

My goal here is to group companies with a global hiring policy. This means: Companies that don't have restrictions on where you can live.
Companies hiring US only, East Coast only, Europe only, etc. shouldn't be included here.

**Some context:** There are lots of lists for remote companies. [@yanirs](https://github.com/yanirs) has this [awesome established remote companies list](https://github.com/yanirs/established-remote), for example. We also have websites such as [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/) and [FindAsync](https://www.findasync.com/) where we can find remote jobs. However, many remote companies don't hire globally.

**Contributions are welcome.**

## Why hiring globally?

Some of the benefits include (feel free to improve this list):

- **Access to a larger talent pool:** When a company limits its hiring to a specific geographic region, it may miss out on highly skilled workers who are located elsewhere. By hiring remote workers globally, a company can tap into a larger talent pool and find the best candidates for each role.
- **Diversity and inclusion:** By hiring remote workers from around the world, a company can create a more diverse and inclusive workforce. This can bring different perspectives and ideas to the table, leading to better problem-solving and innovation.
- **Flexibility:** Employees don't need to worry about where they'll live. They can move abroad and retain their jobs. It also allows for people to have flexible lifestyles (e.g. digital nomads). This can lead to increased job satisfaction and lower turnover rates.
- **Access to new markets:** Hiring remote workers from different regions can provide a company with valuable insights into new markets and customer segments. This can be especially important for companies looking to expand globally, as remote workers can provide on-the-ground knowledge and expertise.
- **24/7 coverage:** When a company hires remote workers from different time zones, it can provide 24/7 coverage for its customers or clients. This can be especially important for companies that have customers in different parts of the world, as it can help to ensure that someone is always available to respond to inquiries or issues.
- **Language skills:** When a company hires remote workers from different regions, it can gain access to a range of language skills. This can be especially important for companies looking to expand globally or serve customers in different parts of the world.
- **Resilience:** Hiring remote workers from different regions can help to make a company more resilient to external factors, such as natural disasters, political unrest, or economic downturns. With a distributed workforce, a company can more easily adapt to changing circumstances and continue to operate effectively in challenging situations.

## How to hire globally?

Companies like [Remote](https://remote.com/) help you to hire globally. They handle payroll and make sure you're fully compliant with local laws.
PS. I'm not being paid to recommend them. I just like their work.

## Rules

Some of the rules to be included in this list:

- The company needs to hire remotely in all continents.
- The company cannot restrict hiring to more than 15 countries.
- The company cannot pay less than $50k/year (USD) for engineering roles.

If you see a company in the list that doesn't meet the criteria above, please let me know or open a PR to remove them.

## Companies hiring globally

- Open salary = Company shares salary information on jobs ads.
- Restrictions = Global hiring with some restrictions. If empty, then we don't know if the company has hiring restrictions.
